# Navigation & Services Update Summary 🎯

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Navbar Buttons Visibility - FIXED ✨
**Problem:** Navbar buttons weren't visible when at the top of the page (transparent background with white text)

**Solution:**
- Changed transparent navbar background to a beautiful gradient (`from-primary-600/95 to-secondary-600/95`)
- Added backdrop blur effect for modern glass-morphism look
- Ensured all text is always visible with proper contrast
- White text on gradient background at top of page
- Dark text on white background when scrolled

**Result:** Navbar is now always visible and looks professional!
